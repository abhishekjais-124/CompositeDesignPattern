# CompositeDesignPattern
LLD for Composite Design Pattern

The composite pattern is meant to allow treating individual objects and compositions of objects, or “composites” in the same way. It can be viewed as a tree structure made up of types that inherit a base type, and it can represent a single part or a whole hierarchy of objects.

Composite pattern is used where we need to treat a group of objects in similar way as a single object. Composite pattern composes objects in term of a tree structure to represent part as well as whole hierarchy.
